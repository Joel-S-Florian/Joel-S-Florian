# 👋 Hi, I’m Joel (Starling Florian)

- 👀 I’m interested in **Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, storytelling, and the intersection between technology and humanities**.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Software Engineering fundamentals, AI/ML, and best practices in coding**.  
- 💻 Technologies I work with: **SQL, C#**.  
- 📈 Currently exploring and want to learn: **C++ and Python**.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **projects related to AI, APIs, and creative applications of technology (games, interactive stories, or research tools)**.  
- 📚 Besides coding, I love **reading (history, philosophy, politics, economics, novels)** and **drawing/writing stories (comics & narratives)**.  
- 📫 How to reach me: *https://github.com/Joel-S-Florian*  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe **technology is a bridge between creativity and problem-solving** — I’m as excited about writing a story as I am about writing an algorithm!
